# Stifte und Mäuse Rewrite

## About
Stifte und Mäuse is a Java library intended to help (German) students to get 
into the programming language. It is frequently used at German schools.
The original library, which you can find [here](http://www.mg-werl.de/sum/SuMWin.zip) 
has multiple components, such as utils, an sql part, a GUI part
and some more. Every part has its own .jar-file.
<br>The idea to rewrite it came after having worked with it for over a year as a student
and having realised how bad it actually is. 
<p>Here are some of the main issues of the original SuM-library:

- It is completely written in German, not only making its code inconsistent but also preventing accessibility.
- It makes use of bad practices all over its code.
- It violates object-oriented programming principles.
- It is outdated. The lib was written in Java 5 and 6. Much has changed since then.

The whole library is to be rewritten. Fortunately, it's not that much.
